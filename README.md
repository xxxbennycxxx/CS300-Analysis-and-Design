For this course, I was solving the problem of building a program that could help advisors at ABCU manage Computer Science course information. The projects needed to store courses, track prerequisites, and allow users to search and sort the courses efficiently. To solve this, I had to decide which data structures would work best. I learned that picking the right data structure really matters because it can make a big difference in how fast and reliable a program is. I used a vector for simple storage, a hash table for fast searching, and a binary search tree for keeping the courses sorted automatically.

While working through the projects, I ran into a few challenges. One of the biggest roadblocks was dealing with file input and making sure the program could read and organize the course data correctly. To fix this, I simplified the program by hardcoding the course data directly into the code for Project Two. This made everything work smoothly without depending on a separate file. I also broke the code into smaller functions, which made it easier to test and fix problems as I went along.

Doing this project helped me think differently about how I design programs. I learned to plan things out first instead of just jumping into the code. It showed me that a clean structure and organized flow make a big difference when building something that has to actually work well. I also realized how important it is to write code that is easy to understand and update. By keeping my functions short and clearly named, and by using a simple format, I made sure that the program would be easy for anyone (including myself later) to read and maintain. Overall, these projects made me a better and more thoughtful programmer. # CS300-Analysis-and-Design
